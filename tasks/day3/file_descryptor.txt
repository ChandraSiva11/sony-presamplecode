These functions operate on I/O streams referred to using file descriptors. The file descriptor will be outside of the file.

In Unix and related computer operating systems, a file descriptor is an abstract indicator used to access a file or other input/output resource, such as a pipe or network socket. File descriptors form part of the POSIX application programming interface. A file descriptor is a non-negative integer, generally represented in the C programming language as the type int (negative values being reserved to indicate "no value" or an error condition). 

1) Low/Kernel level handler.
2) passes to read() and write() of UNIX System Calls.
3) Doesn't include buffering and such features.
4) Less portable and lacks efficiency.



POSIX stands for Portable Operating System Interface, and is an IEEE standard designed to facilitate application portability. POSIX is an attempt by a consortium of vendors to create a single standard version of UNIX. If they are successful, it will make it easier to port applications between hardware platforms.
