Shallow Copy
------------
    A shallow copy means constructing a new collection object and then populating it with references to the child objects found in the original. In essence, a shallow copy is only one level deep. The copying process does not recurse and therefore wonâ€™t create copies of the child objects themselves.

    Making Shallow Copy
    -------------------
    	xs = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

Deep copy
---------
    A deep copy makes the copying process recursive. It means first constructing a new collection object and then recursively populating it with copies of the child objects found in the original. Copying an object this way walks the whole object tree to create a fully independent clone of the original object and all of its children.

    Making deep copy
    ---------------
    	ys = list(xs)
