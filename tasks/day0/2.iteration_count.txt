Problem 1
	iteration count : 6
	output : 1 2 3 4 5 6 6
	Reason : The initial iteration value started from 1 and end value is 7, but end value will always be -1 added.

Problem 2
	iteration count : 7
	output : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 
	Reason : start iteration is 0, end is 7 but it will be considered as (7-1)

Problem 3
	iteration count : 8
	output : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7
	Reason : While condition checking <= 7

Problem 4
	iteration count : 7
	output : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 6
	Reason : while condition checking <7

Problem 5
	iteration count : 0
	output : 0
	Reason : in range start and end vlue is same it will not go inside for condition

Problem 6
	iteration count : 8
	output : -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 4
	Reason : Start value is -3

Problem 7
	iteration count : 5
	output : 0 1 2 3 4 4
	Reason : start and end value with in the range

Problem 8
	iteration count : 5
	output : 1 2 3 4 5 5
	Reason : if condition will break the iteration while it reaches 5

Problem 9
	iteration count : 5
	output : 1 3 5 7 9 9
	Reason : Each iteration value is incremented by 2

Problem 10
	iteration count : 7
	output : 1 2 3 4 5 9 10 10
	Reason : When iteration reaches 5 the i value is directly incremented by 4

Problem 11
	iteration count : 25
	output : 1 1 2 3 4 5   2 1 2 3 4 5   3 1 2 3 4 5   4 1 2 3 4 5   5 1 2 3 4 5    5 5
	Reason : nested looping is there 

Problem 12
	iteration count : 7
	output : 1 1 2 3 4 5    6 5
	Reason : When j vlue become even i value is added by 2, So j value when it reached 2 and 4 i is added by 2. So finally it will reach to 6
