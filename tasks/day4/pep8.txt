Introduction
------------
This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising the standard library in the main Python distribution. Please see the companion informational PEP describing style guidelines for the C code in the C implementation of Python [1].

This document and PEP 257 (Docstring Conventions) were adapted from Guido's original Python Style Guide essay, with some additions from Barry's style guide [2].

This style guide evolves over time as additional conventions are identified and past conventions are rendered obsolete by changes in the language itself.

Many projects have their own coding style guidelines. In the event of any conflicts, such project-specific guides take precedence for that project.

Code Lay-out
------------
Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces, or using a hanging indent [7]. When using a hanging indent the following should be considered; there should be no arguments on the first line and further indentation should be used to clearly distinguish itself as a continuation 

Advantage
---------
When applying the guideline would make the code more readable, even for someone who is used to reading code that follows this PEP.
